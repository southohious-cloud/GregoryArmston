# 🧠 Problem Set 2

## Overview

Problem Set 2 focuses on string manipulation, conditional logic, and basic parsing. These exercises reinforce clean input handling, rule‑based decisions, and predictable output formatting.

## Files

1. [**01_camel.py**](01_camel.py)  
   Converts a camelCase variable name into snake_case. Practices character inspection, string building, and naming‑style transformation.

2. [**02_coke.py**](02_coke.py)  
   Simulates a Coke vending machine that accepts specific coin values until the total is paid. Reinforces loops, subtraction, and input validation.

3. [**03_twttr.py**](03_twttr.py)  
   Removes vowels from user input to create a shortened “Twitter‑style” output. Strengthens iteration and filtering logic.

4. [**04_plates.py**](04_plates.py)  
   Validates vanity plate strings based on custom rules. Applies slicing, digit handling, and multi‑step conditional checks.

5. [**05_nutrition.py**](05_nutrition.py)  
   Maps fruit names to their calorie values. Reinforces dictionary lookups and case‑insensitive string handling.
