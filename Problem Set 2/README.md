# 🧩 Problem Set 2

## Overview  
Problem Set 2 deepens my work with strings, loops, and validation. These exercises emphasize incremental input processing, rule enforcement, and transforming text according to clear patterns.

## Files  
1. **`01_camel.py`**  
   Converts a `camelCase` identifier into `snake_case`, reinforcing character‑by‑character iteration and conditional string building.

2. **`02_coke.py`**  
   Simulates a vending machine that accepts coins until a target amount is reached, practicing loops, arithmetic, and state tracking.

3. **`03_twttr.py`**  
   Removes vowels from a string to simulate tweet‑style text, strengthening string traversal, filtering, and simple transformation.

4. **`04_plates.py`**  
   Validates vanity license plates according to a set of rules, emphasizing multi‑step validation, ordering constraints, and helper‑based logic.

5. **`05_nutrition.py`**  
   Looks up the calorie count of a fruit from a predefined table, reinforcing dictionary usage, normalization, and guarded lookups.
