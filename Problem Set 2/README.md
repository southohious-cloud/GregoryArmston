# 🧩 Problem Set 2

## Overview  
Problem Set 2 focuses on loops, validation, and rule‑based logic. These exercises strengthen your ability to enforce constraints, repeatedly process user input, and transform text with precision.

## Files  
1. **`01_plates.py`**  
   Validates a proposed vanity license plate according to a set of rules, combining loops, conditionals, and string checks.

2. **`02_camel.py`**  
   Converts camelCase text into snake_case, practicing iteration and character‑by‑character transformation.

3. **`03_coke.py`**  
   Simulates a vending machine that accepts coins until a target amount is reached, reinforcing loops, arithmetic, and state tracking.
