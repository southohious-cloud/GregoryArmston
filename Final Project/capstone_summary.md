Project Title: [Insert Your Project Name Here]

Overview:
· A Python-based capstone project designed to solve a real-world problem or demonstrate a complete system.
· Implements modular architecture with a main function and at least three custom functions.
· Includes automated testing via pytest and dependency tracking via requirements.txt.

Structure:
· project.py — main program logic
  · Contains main() and three+ top-level functions
  · Functions are not nested; each handles a distinct task

· test_project.py — unit tests
  · Mirrors function names with test_ prefix
  · Validates core logic using pytest

· requirements.txt — dependencies
  · Lists pip-installable libraries, one per line

Design Highlights:
· Input validation and error handling across all functions
· Modular design for readability and reuse
· Optional use of classes, external libraries, or APIs
· Documented usage and structure for clarity

Submission Notes:
· All files placed in root directory
· Code meets CS50P's academic honesty and formatting standards
· Project exceeds effort and scope of individual problem sets
