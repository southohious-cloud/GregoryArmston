# 🧩 Final Project

## Overview  
The Final Project is your opportunity to design and implement a complete Python program of your choosing. This capstone demonstrates your ability to combine everything learned throughout CS50P — from functions and file handling to classes, libraries, testing, and clean program structure.

## Requirements  
- Your project must be written in Python.  
- It should solve a real problem, automate a task, or create something meaningful.  
- The program must be thoughtfully designed, well‑structured, and logically organized.  
- Your code should be clear, readable, and appropriately commented.  
- A video walkthrough (per CS50P guidelines) must accompany your submission.

## Files  
1. **`project.py`**  
   The main Python program implementing your project’s functionality, written with clean structure, modular design, and clear logic.

2. **`README.md`**  
   A detailed description of your project’s purpose, design decisions, features, and usage instructions.

3. **Any additional files required by your program**  
   Such as data files, images, modules, or configuration assets necessary for your project to run.

## Submission  
Follow CS50P’s final project submission instructions, including uploading your code, README, and video walkthrough.
