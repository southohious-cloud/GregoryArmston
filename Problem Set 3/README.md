# 🔢 Problem Set 3

## Overview

Problem Set 3 focuses on parsing, validation, and rule‑based logic. These exercises strengthen your ability to interpret user input, apply structured conditions, and produce consistent, predictable output.

## Files

1. [**01_fuel.py**](01_fuel.py)  
   Converts a fraction into a fuel gauge percentage and prints a status indicator. Reinforces parsing, integer validation, and threshold‑based conditionals.

2. [**02_taqueria.py**](02_taqueria.py)  
   Calculates the running total of menu items ordered from a taqueria. Practices dictionary lookups, cumulative totals, and input validation.

3. [**03_grocery.py**](03_grocery.py)  
   Counts grocery items entered by the user and prints a sorted summary. Strengthens frequency counting, normalization, and dictionary usage.

4. [**04_outdated.py**](04_outdated.py)  
   Converts various date formats into a standardized ISO format. Applies string parsing, error handling, and multi‑branch logic.
