# 🧩 Problem Set 3

## Overview  
Problem Set 3 introduces more advanced string processing, validation, and modular design. These programs reinforce your ability to break problems into smaller components, normalize user input, and apply rule‑based logic with precision.

## Files  
1. **`01_fuel.py`**  
   Converts a user‑provided fraction into a fuel gauge reading, practicing input validation, exception handling, and conditional output formatting.

2. **`02_taqueria.py`**  
   Simulates a taqueria ordering system by summing item prices from a predefined menu, reinforcing dictionaries, normalization, and loop‑based accumulation.

3. **`03_grocery.py`**  
   Counts grocery items entered by the user and prints a sorted summary, strengthening dictionary usage, case normalization, and frequency tracking.

4. **`04_outdated.py`**  
   Converts various date formats into a standardized ISO format, applying parsing, validation, and careful conditional logic.
