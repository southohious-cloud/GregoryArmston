# 🧩 Problem Set 7

## Overview  
Problem Set 7 introduces regular expressions, deeper string validation, and more advanced parsing techniques. These exercises strengthen your ability to match patterns, extract structured information, and enforce precise input rules.

## Files  
1. **`01_numb3rs.py`**  
   Validates IPv4 addresses using regular expressions, reinforcing pattern matching and strict input constraints.

2. **`02_watch.py`**  
   Extracts timestamps from HTML `<iframe>` embed codes, practicing regex groups, parsing, and selective data extraction.

3. **`03_working.py`**  
   Converts human‑readable time ranges into 24‑hour format, emphasizing regex validation, parsing, and careful boundary handling.

4. **`04_um.py`**  
   Counts standalone occurrences of the word “um” in text, strengthening word‑boundary matching and case‑insensitive pattern design.

5. **`05_response.py`**  
   Validates email addresses using regular expressions, reinforcing pattern construction and robust input checking.
