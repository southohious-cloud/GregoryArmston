# 🧩 Problem Set 5

## Overview  
Problem Set 5 introduces unit testing as a core part of program design. These exercises formalize expectations for earlier problem set functions, reinforcing test‑driven thinking, edge‑case coverage, and modular structure.

## Files  
1. **[`01_test_twttr.py`](01_test_twttr.py)**  
   Confirms that the vowel‑stripping logic behaves as expected across different strings, cases, and special characters.

2. **[`02_test_bank.py`](02_test_bank.py)**  
   Tests the `value` function from the bank program, checking multiple greeting formats, edge cases, and normalization behavior.

3. **[`03_test_plates.py`](03_test_plates.py)**  
   Exercises the license plate validator with a wide range of valid and invalid examples, ensuring each rule is correctly enforced.

4. **[`04_test_fuel.py`](04_test_fuel.py)**  
   Verifies the fuel gauge logic, including valid fractions, boundary conditions, and error handling for invalid input.
