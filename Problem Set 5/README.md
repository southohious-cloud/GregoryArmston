# 🧩 Problem Set 5

## Overview  
Problem Set 5 introduces unit testing with `pytest`, emphasizing predictable function behavior, clean logic, and comprehensive test coverage. Each exercise focuses on writing functions that can be validated through automated tests.

## Files  
1. **`01_twttr.py`**  
   Removes vowels from text to simulate a shortened “Twitter‑style” output, reinforcing string filtering and testable function design.

2. **`02_bank.py`**  
   Evaluates greetings and returns a dollar amount based on politeness, practicing normalization, branching logic, and consistent return values.

3. **`03_plate.py`**  
   Validates vanity license plates according to a strict set of rules, emphasizing modular checks, helper functions, and thorough test coverage.

4. **`04_refuel.py`**  
   Converts a fraction into a fuel gauge reading, reinforcing exception handling, input validation, and predictable function behavior.
