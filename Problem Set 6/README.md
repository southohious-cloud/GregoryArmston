# 🧩 Problem Set 6

## Overview  
Problem Set 6 introduces file handling, CSV processing, and image manipulation using Pillow. These exercises reinforce modular thinking, third-party library usage, and robust input validation across diverse formats.

## Files  
1. **[01_lines.py](01_lines.py)**  
   Counts lines of actual code in a Python file, excluding comments and blank lines. Strengthens file reading and filtering logic.

2. **[02_pizza.py](02_pizza.py)**  
   Parses a CSV file of pizza orders and prints a formatted table using tabulate. Practices CSV handling and external module integration.

3. **[03_scourgify.py](03_scourgify.py)**  
   Cleans up a messy CSV file by reformatting names and writing to a new file. Reinforces string manipulation and CSV I/O.

4. **[04_shirt.py](04_shirt.py)**  
   Uses Pillow to overlay a shirt image onto a user-provided photo. Introduces image processing, error handling, and file validation.
