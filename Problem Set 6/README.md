# 🧩 Problem Set 6

## Overview  
Problem Set 6 focuses on file handling, CSV processing, and image manipulation. These exercises strengthen your ability to read, transform, and write data while working with external files and libraries.

## Files  
1. **`01_lines.py`**  
   Counts the number of lines of actual code in a Python file, ignoring comments and blank lines, reinforcing file I/O and filtering logic.

2. **`02_pizza.py`**  
   Reads a CSV file containing pizza menu information and prints it in a neatly formatted table, practicing CSV parsing and structured output.

3. **`03_scourgify.py`**  
   Cleans and restructures a CSV file of student names, converting “last, first” into a standardized format and writing the results to a new file.

4. **`04_shirt.py`**  
   Overlays a shirt image onto another image using the Pillow library, reinforcing image manipulation, resizing, and file validation.
