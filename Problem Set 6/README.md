# 🧩 Problem Set 6

## Overview
Problem Set 6 introduces file handling, CSV processing, and image manipulation using Pillow. These exercises reinforce modular thinking, third‑party library usage, and robust input validation across diverse formats.

## Files

1. [01_lines.py](https://github.com/southohious-cloud/GregoryArmston/blob/main/Problem%20Set%206/01_lines.py)  
   Counts lines of actual code in a Python file, excluding comments and blank lines.

2. [02_pizza.py](https://github.com/southohious-cloud/GregoryArmston/blob/main/Problem%20Set%206/02_pizza.py)  
   Parses a CSV file of pizza orders and prints a formatted table using `tabulate`.

3. [03_scourgify.py](https://github.com/southohious-cloud/GregoryArmston/blob/main/Problem%20Set%206/03_scourgify.py)  
   Cleans up a messy CSV file by reformatting names and writing to a new file.

4. [04_shirt.py](https://github.com/southohious-cloud/GregoryArmston/blob/main/Problem%20Set%206/04_shirt.py)  
   Uses Pillow to overlay a shirt image onto a user‑provided photo.
