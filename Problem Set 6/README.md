# 🧩 Problem Set 6

## Overview  
Problem Set 6 introduces file handling, data persistence, and CSV processing. These exercises strengthen your ability to read, write, and transform structured data while reinforcing defensive programming and clean modular design.

## Files  
1. **`01_lines.py`**  
   Counts the number of lines of actual code in a Python file, ignoring comments and blank lines to reinforce file I/O and filtering logic.

2. **`02_shirt.py`**  
   Overlays a shirt graphic onto a user‑provided image, applying image manipulation, error handling, and library‑based processing with Pillow.

3. **`03_pizza.py`**  
   Reads a CSV file of pizza data and prints it as a formatted table, practicing CSV parsing, column alignment, and structured output.

4. **`04_scourgify.py`**  
   Cleans and restructures a CSV file of student names, reinforcing CSV parsing, field normalization, and writing well‑formatted output files.

5. **`05_shirtificate.py`**  
   Generates a personalized certificate image with a name printed on it, combining image composition, text rendering, and layout control.
