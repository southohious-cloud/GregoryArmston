👋 Hi, I’m Gregory Armston
Creative Technologist • Workflow Architect • AI Automation Systems
I design and build modular, scalable, business‑grade AI automation engines that blend technical rigor with premium presentation. My work sits at the intersection of Python architecture, workflow orchestration, identity‑preserving automation, and brand‑aligned system design.
I’m obsessed with clarity, modularity, and building systems that feel as good as they function.

🚀 What I Build
• 	AI Workflow Engines with clean, extensible architecture
• 	Intent‑driven automation pipelines that route tasks intelligently
• 	Identity‑preserving NLP systems for business‑grade use cases
• 	Premium, client‑ready tooling with strong visual hierarchy
• 	Portfolio‑level modular repos designed for long‑term scalability

🧠 Core Skills
• 	Modular Python architecture & workflow orchestration
• 	Systematic troubleshooting across Windows, GitHub Desktop, OneDrive, CS50
• 	Premium branding, README writing, and project presentation
• 	AI‑assisted collaboration and iterative refinement
• 	Designing printable, referenceable technical resources

🔧 Current Focus
I’m currently building Phase 1 of a full AI Workflow Engine, with a clean, modular repo structure designed for:
• 	Extensibility
• 	Business‑grade reliability
• 	Clear documentation
• 	Identity‑aligned branding
I’m also refining my environment setup to ensure seamless development across Windows, GitHub Desktop, and cloud‑synced workspaces.

🎨 How I Work
I believe in:
• 	Clean slates when needed — clarity beats clutter
• 	Modularity over monoliths
• 	Premium presentation as a core part of engineering
• 	Iterative refinement with AI as a collaborative partner
• 	Systems that scale technically and visually
