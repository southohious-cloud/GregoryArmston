# 🧩 Problem Set 1

## Overview  
Problem Set 1 expands into conditionals, string evaluation, and basic data lookup. These programs strengthen your ability to interpret user input and respond with structured logic.

## Files  
1. **`01_faces.py`**  
   Converts text‑based emoticons into emoji characters using conditional checks.

2. **`02_nutrition.py`**  
   Looks up the calorie count of a fruit from a predefined dictionary, reinforcing key/value access and input normalization.

3. **`03_extensions.py`**  
   Determines a file’s media type based on its extension, practicing string parsing and conditional branching.

4. **`04_interpreter.py`**  
   Evaluates simple arithmetic expressions entered by the user, introducing parsing and basic computation.
