﻿# 🧩 Problem Set 1

## Overview  
Problem Set 1 focuses on foundational Python control flow, user input handling, and basic string and numeric processing. These exercises build confidence in conditional logic, simple parsing, and mapping user input to structured responses.

## Files  
1. **`01_deep.py`**  
   Checks whether the user provides the correct answer to a specific question, reinforcing normalization, comparison, and conditional branching.

2. **`02_bank.py`**  
   Interprets a user’s greeting and returns a dollar amount based on its content, practicing string methods and rule‑based conditionals.

3. **`03_extensions.py`**  
   Maps a file’s extension to its corresponding media type, strengthening string parsing, case handling, and lookup logic.

4. **`04_interpreter.py`**  
   Evaluates a simple arithmetic expression provided as a string, applying splitting, casting, and operator‑based branching.

5. **`05_meal.py`**  
   Converts a time string into a meal period, reinforcing time parsing, numeric comparison, and clean function design.
