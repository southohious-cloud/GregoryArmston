# 🧩 Problem Set 1

## Overview

Problem Set 1 focuses on foundational Python control flow, user input handling, and basic string and numeric processing. These exercises build confidence in conditional logic, simple parsing, and mapping user input to structured responses.

## Files

1. [**deep.py**](deep.py)  
   Checks whether the user provides the correct answer to a specific question, reinforcing normalization, comparison, and conditional branching.

2. [**bank.py**](bank.py)  
   Interprets a user’s greeting and returns a dollar amount based on its content. Practices string methods, prefix detection, and rule‑based conditionals.

3. [**extensions.py**](extensions.py)  
   Maps a file’s extension to its corresponding media type. Strengthens string parsing, case handling, and lookup logic.

4. [**interpreter.py**](interpreter.py)  
   Evaluates a simple arithmetic expression provided as a string. Applies splitting, casting, and operator‑based branching.

5. [**meal.py**](meal.py)  
   Converts a time string into a meal period. Reinforces time parsing, numeric comparison, and clean function design.
