# 🧱 Problem Set 8

Problem Set 8 introduces object‑oriented programming, focusing on classes, methods, encapsulation, and stateful design. These exercises reinforce structured modeling, behavior‑driven logic, and clean class architecture.

## Files
**01_seasons.py**  
Calculates the number of minutes a person has been alive, using date parsing, validation, and class‑based structure.

**01_test_seasons.py**  
Verifies correct date parsing, validation, and minute‑calculation logic for the Seasons class, including edge cases and invalid inputs.

**02_jar.py**  
Implements a Cookie Jar class with capacity limits, deposit and withdraw behavior, and accurate string representation.

**02_test_jar.py**  
Tests the Cookie Jar class for proper capacity handling, deposit and withdraw behavior, and accurate string representation.

**03_shirtificate.py**  
Generates a CS50 “shirtificate” image using object‑oriented design and the Pillow library.

**03_test_shirtificate.py**  
Ensures the Shirtificate generator creates the output image correctly, validating text placement, file creation, and Pillow‑based rendering.
