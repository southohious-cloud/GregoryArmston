# 🧩 Problem Set 4

## Overview  
Problem Set 4 emphasizes modular design through functions, structured input handling, and clean separation of logic. These programs reinforce reusable components, predictable behavior, and disciplined program flow.

## Files  
1. **`01_emojize.py`**  
   Converts colon‑based emoji codes into actual emoji characters, practicing string parsing and library‑based substitution.

2. **`02_letters.py`**  
   Analyzes a block of text and reports the percentage of characters that are letters, reinforcing iteration, filtering, and function‑based structure.

3. **`03_adieu.py`**  
   Produces a farewell message that grammatically lists multiple names, strengthening list handling, joining logic, and conditional formatting.

4. **`04_game.py`**  
   Implements a number‑guessing game with difficulty levels, reinforcing random number generation, loops, and structured conditional feedback.

5. **`05_little_professor.py`**  
   Generates arithmetic quizzes for students, practicing randomization, input validation, scoring, and function‑driven program design.

6. **`06_bitcoin.py`**  
   Fetches the current Bitcoin price from an API and calculates the cost of a user‑specified amount, reinforcing API usage, JSON parsing, and error handling.tering.
